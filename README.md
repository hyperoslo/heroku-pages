# Heroku Pages

[![Code Climate](https://img.shields.io/codeclimate/github/hyperoslo/heroku-pages.svg?style=flat)](https://codeclimate.com/github/hyperoslo/heroku-pages)

Easily inspect, view and upload your [Heroku error and maintenance pages](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-pages#customize-pages).

**Supported Ruby versions: 1.9.3 or higher**

Licensed under the **MIT** license, see LICENSE for more information.


## Installation

This is a Heroku client plugin and as such requires the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) to be installed.

```shell
heroku plugins:install https://github.com/hyperoslo/heroku-pages.git
```


## Usage

If you have multiple apps, you may specify either app or remote:

```shell
heroku pages -a hyper-rocks-staging
heroku pages -r staging
```

### Inspecting

To view the current set of Heroku pages:

```shell
heroku pages
```

### Opening / Viewing

To open all Heroku pages using the default application (which tends to be a browser):

```shell
heroku pages:open
```

### Uploading to S3

To upload your Heroku pages to S3 using [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli):

```shell
heroku pages:upload
```

It assumes the following configuration variables to be present for the given app:

- `AWS_REGION`
- `AWS_BUCKET`
- `AWS_KEY` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET` or `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

The folder `public/heroku_pages` is assumed to be present in your project.

Remote folder `heroku_pages` on your S3 bucket will be created and all files uploaded to it will be made public.

**Note**: Any hidden files - files starting with `.` - will not be uploaded.

### Configuring

Both `MAINTENANCE_PAGE_URL` and `ERROR_PAGE_URL` environment variables can be set automatically on Heroku:

```shell
heroku pages:configure
```

It assumes `heroku_pages/maintenance.html` and one of `heroku_pages/error.html`
or `heroku_pages/500.html` to be present on your S3 bucket.
